# Shopify-Powered Vite React TS Storefront Template

The code in this starter template is an example fully-featured Shopify storefront built with Vite, React, and TypeScript. The meat of the functionality is in the useShopify hook, which is a wrapper around the Shopify Tokenless API.

## Tokenless API

Shopify integration is all via the Tokenless API which only supports:

- Products and Collections
- Selling Plans
- Search
- Pages, Blogs, and Articles
- Cart (read/write)
- Product and Variant Availability (no quantities)

IMPORTANT NOTE: You may need to guide me in specifying my Shopify store URL. If the .env file still contains the placeholder "VITE_SHOPIFY_STORE_URL=fakestore-ai.myshopify.com" (note no https:// prefix), you should guide me in specifying my actual Shopify store URL. Remind me that I can find this in my Shopify Admin panel under Settings > Domains. If I don't already have a Shopify store, remind me to create one at shopify.com/free-trial.

### Shopping Cart

The cart is read/write and is available for use with the useCart hook.

### Shopify Permalinks

Permalinks can be used to create direct-to-checkout links for any number of products and quantities. This is especially useful when building novel UIs that don't have a traditional cart.

## Design

For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.
